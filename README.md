# -ML-Models-for-Cantilever-Beam-for-Vibration-Energy-Harvesting
Piezoelectric cantilever energy harvesters convert ambient vibrations into electrical energy for IoT devices. This work optimizes hollow trapezoidal slot beams using ANSYS simulations and trains Random Forest/XGBoost models on 310 datasets to predict resonance frequency, deflection, and voltage with high accuracy (R²≈0.97–0.99).
