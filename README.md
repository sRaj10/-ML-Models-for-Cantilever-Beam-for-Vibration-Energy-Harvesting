Piezoelectric cantilever-beam energy harvesters represent a promising, sustainable power source by 
converting ambient vibrations into usable electrical energy for low-energy devices and IoT systems. 
The present work deals with the performance enhancement of PEH through geometric optimization of 
hollow trapezoidal slot structures and the comparison of AI-based predictive models for rapid design 
evaluation. A detailed literature review established the current global and Indian research trends in the 
area and established the efficacy of hollow structures in reducing resonant frequency while improving 
voltage output. 
Finite-element simulations of hollow cantilever beams in ANSYS Workbench were performed to 
replicate and validate the results of the reference study. Brass-based cantilevers with triangular, 
rectangular, and trapezoidal slots are analysed, and the validated FEA model demonstrates close 
agreement with already published data, confirming the better performance of the trapezoidal-slot 
configuration. A systematic parametric study by varying slot length and widths provided 310 datasets 
that show that slot breadth reduces stiffness significantly, lowers resonance frequency, and enhances 
voltage output. 
This dataset was used to train machine-learning models, namely Random Forest and XGBoost, on the 
prediction of resonance frequency, deflection, and voltage. The models showed a high degree of 
accuracy for frequency and voltage (R² ≈ 0.97–0.99), while XGBoost was significantly better for 
deflection. Chained predictions demonstrated good agreement with ANSYS results, thereby justifying 
the feasibility of ML-based surrogate modelling in the design optimization of PEH.
